# Intersections
Intersections in Linear Algebra help find points where flat objects intersect. Worth noting, geometric objects are often
expressed as a set of all points satisfying a particular equation. Orthogonality is a very important concept in
intersections. Make sure you learn those first.

## Two lines in two Dimensions
A line in 2D can be represented by pieces of information:
* Basepoint(b): any point on a line.
* Direction vector(u): defining the direction of the line.

Formula will then be f(t) = b + tu .
