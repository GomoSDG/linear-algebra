# intersections
intersections in linear algebra help find points where flat objects intersect. worth noting, geometric objects are often
expressed as a set of all points satisfying a particular equation. [orthogonality](../vectors/readme.md) is an important
concept in
intersections. make sure you learn those first.

## Two lines in two dimensions
a line in 2d can be represented by pieces of information:
* Basepoint(b): any point on a line.
* Direction vector(u): defining the direction of the line.

the formula f(t) = b + tu will then define a set of points that satisfy the given flat object.

### Parametric representation of lines
A line is a set of collinear vectors.
S = { cV1 | c E R } there give V1, equation is V1 * n1 = 0
Where V1 is a direction vector and n1 is the normal vector?

**Line Parallel to point:**\

### Reconstructing the Basepoint and Direction
Ax + By = k where A, B, and k are numbers and k shifts the line up and down.

**Basepoint:**\
if B != 0 then  take x=0 solve for y\
if A != 0 then take y=0 solve for x

**Direction Vector:**\
Also a line connecting two points on a line (the difference thereof).

### Intersection of Two Dimensional Lines
*
* Two lines are parallel if normal vectors are not parallel.
* If they are parallel they are either coincidental they are either not intersecting or the same line.
