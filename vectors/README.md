# Vector Operations and Properties

## Parallel Vectors
v1 and v2 are parrallel if one is a scalar multiple of the other. This
means that they lay on the same line or plane. This also means the angle
between the two is either 0 degrees or 180 degrees. since 1 * v1 = v1,
v1 is parallel to v1.

## Orthogonal Vectors
Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is 0. This means they
are either perpendicular or one of them is a zero vector.

## Zero Vector
The zero vector is both orthogonal and parallel to all vectors of the
same dimension.
